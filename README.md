## Task
The goal of this task is to create a basic Express.js server that provides specific details related to Frank Sinatra The Epic Singer. The challenge lies in understanding the basic routing mechanism in Express.js and ensuring the server responds correctly to different request routes.

## Description
I have utilized the Express.js framework to set up a lightweight server. Endpoints have been designed for the following information (birthdate, birth city, wives, picture, and random song). The random song is retrieved using a utility function that randomly picks from an array of total 20 Sinatra's songs.

## Installation
Nothing is required. Everything is run using the terminal and gandalf

## Usage
type node app.js in the terminal to run the application
Type gandalf to run any unit test
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
